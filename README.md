Ceasar Cipher Encryption Project
Author: Alexander Reau

Objective:
To ask the user if they want to encrypt or decode based on the Caesar cipher method.

If the user types in "encode," the program will shift the user typed messaged based
the shift number inputed by the user and return the encrpyted text

If the user types in "decode," the program will shift back the encoded text to
reveal the original text


About Caesar Cipher Encrpytion:
Caesar cipher encryption is one of the most simple and commonly well know encryption methods
known. The encryption works by shifting the alphabet by a number determined by the writer.
An example with a shift number of 3 would turn A into D, B into E, and so on.
